### 2. API (NodeJS and ExpressJS)
   [AK] Created a shell API using NodeJS by following this [example](https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/secure-rest-api-in-nodejs)  
   
    Use following commands to run it  
        - npm install  
        - npm start  
    This will start the API server on port 3600. 
 
### 3. Datastore (Cosmos DB with Mongos API)

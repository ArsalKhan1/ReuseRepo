## Functionalities

## 1. Search
The articles are tagged with key words and user can search for reuse articles using those. User can type the key words in search bar and hit search button.

The web site also support a cool feature of detecting objects off an uploaded image. This really comes handy when an item has multiple reusable components. For example, user can upload image of a bicycle and web site not only detects bicycle as one of the objects, it also detects bicycle parts like tire etc.

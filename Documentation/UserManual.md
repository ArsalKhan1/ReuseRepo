# User Manual

## Overview
We created a community website that helps people find and create ideas to reuse items which would otherwise go in the garbage or recycling.

## Functionalities

While the web site allows anyone to search for articles, it allows registered users to create and publish articles.

## 1. Search
The articles are tagged with key words, and the user can search for reuse articles by typing in the key words in the search bar, and then clicking the search button.

The web site also supports a cool feature of detecting objects off an uploaded image. This really comes handy when an item has multiple reusable components. For example, a user can upload an image of a bicycle, and the web site not only detects bicycle as one of the objects, but also detects bicycle parts such as tire etc.
